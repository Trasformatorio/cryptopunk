# Clean?

by Luther 4/10/2016

They had set "the rule" in January 2019, just after the great Beijing uprising. And the rule had brought him there, in Caracas, under that electric pylon. It was two minutes to midnight.
The air was warm and smelled like shit.

It is said that the idea of the rule circulated (before) like an old joke.

> In a commuter bus, which always makes the same route, the regular travelers after years of traveling had numbered all the jokes they knew.
>
> One day a new commuter came in and watched for a while these friends that were giving each other numbers laughing like crazy. ¨25! ¨ he said one sitting in the back and everyone laugh. ¨73! ¨ replied an other and down all a sneer.
>
> After a few days (and travels) the newcomer trying to breack the ice gambles' a ¨12¨.
> Nobody laughed. 
>
> "Hey, why don't you laugh?" he asked, annoyed. 
> "Because you can't tell it" - replied impassive the friends.

That evening ten years earlier, in the *Roodetopper*, an Amsterdam bar, sat three disgruntled hackers, chatting about nothing, while watching the images of the Peking massacres anesthetized by a CNN speaker. She was  talkingin front of her with the red microphone near her mouth while behind the massacre unfolded. They had gotten the barman to turn off the volume and the silent flatscreen was chilling the room with its surreal stare.

One of them broke the silence complaining about how the capital continued to steal cutting edge words and put copyright on them. It was a semantic war that had been going on since the early XX century. How to stop it?

Someone, perhaps Lara, said she heard some CISCO marketing manager looking for customers talking about the "soul" of the city.

He said ¨we have not to worry about the smartness of the city, but about her soul¨.

And with the sad face of one who has seen many times important words escape from the neat pages of her experience and become gallows and forks to be manovered by the hands of the PR Spin Doctors, she added: ¨ "We lost **love** to the advertisers, we lost **friends** to Facebook, we are going to lose **soul** to Cisco. "
At that point one of the three, perhaps Hagbard, told the famous joke for the third time.
And the third, giggling, proposed to number that joke as well. At that point they understood and began to code.

At first only a few keywords were released as #hash. "Future" was the first. It worked like this: an encrypted pointer replaced the word in any text. From what moment it remained in a P2P distributed public blockchain.

Anyone could refer the term with a cryptographic hash instead of the word. Whenever a communication office, a politician, a spin doctor in the pay of this or that ideology somehow wanted to appropriate the concept and to bend the meaning of the word in **the underneath**, there was an automatic agreement, and the hash was changed to that word.

From that moment on Futuro (#AF89332 : md5 5b876d360b6f064e029667eacc23efac) had a new iteration on the chain, and in the world of communication it changed color.

As soon as a communication office tried to appropriate a word, an automatic alarm, made up of watchlists and coded shields on distributed servers, gave a new iteration to the word and moved it one step in the blockchain. Future changes to #AB00394. A very small distributed software performed the substitution, and all the meanings of the term passed to the new hash. The advantage was obvious. Enough with semantic theft.

All the words had to remain in the commons, and on this in theory everyone agreed in principle.
But in trying to do this using traditional systems, the creative vanguard had always been on the loosing end. Until now.

This especially took hold among kids. Not only did they used color codes to identify free words, but  learned them by heart, and started using the hash instead of the semantic version indifferently in conversations. The filters became very powerful. Using the free hashed variant of a couple of terms you could avoid an entire multimillion-dollar campaign, filtered out of your screens, your digital books, the commercials they sent you home, even from live political broadcasts ...
At first words like "family" (#EHD999), Happiness (#FFFFFF9), but with time entire dictionaries. You could choose to read only the words used by commoneers. "Free words for the free world".

Thinking about how those out of the game waved to try to chase you with their capitalist semantics, you felt like those old friends in the bus ... you laughed, how much you laughed...



Now he was there, crouched under a trellis in Caracas, on a warm, slouching New Year's night. He hadn't coded for years, he no longer owned a computer, moved from one shelter to the next paying in splinters of ancient knowledge young hackers curious about hearing stories of a veteran.

A complicated life. 

Yet she still happily carved out those moments for himself, in which to defecate outdoors, looking at the stars, and using the smooth skeleton of an old black iPhone as a stone, to wipe his ass.
